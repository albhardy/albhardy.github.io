The definition of facilitate is "to make easy" or "ease a process." In the broadest sense, Facilitation is both art and science of making group’s work easier by structuring the process and guiding group members participation. It becomes especially important as organisation embraces Design Thinking, Co-creation and UX practices, where they open the design process not just users but to also a much wider range of stakeholders. 

However ideas and outputs don’t just simply happen despite best intentions. Being a good facilitator isn’t the same as knowing how to manage people or run a meeting. It all comes down to understanding the tools–and structure–that help people collaborate. Designers need to become skilled communicators and facilitators, as they lead engagement initiatives with diverse group of stakeholders and bridge communication gaps in design process. A team that has a well-trained design facilitator can come to a drastically different outcome because they understand what it takes to create the right environment for good design to happen, and shape teams and clients towards shared understanding and successful outcomes. 

The workshop explained core facilitation practice such as active listening, ask questions and bring neutral stance to encourage participation, keep group on task/purpose and ensure that the group's objectives and deliverables of the session are met. As such, facilitator must take care of:

- Outcomes (deliverables of the session)
- Process (tools and techniques)
- Time
- I (neutrality as facilitator)
- Context (culture and group dynamics)
- Space (physical and emotive)

They must also be able to set aside their personal views, take a step back from bringing the detailed content, and focus purely on the “group process”. In this way, facilitator could bring shared understanding, get the best ideation from all members and bring the event toward successful decision, solution or conclusion. One reason facilitation is becoming an even more important job skill going forward is because organizations will need people who know how to harness all that diversity of thought and channel it productively. Finally, diverse workforces often need to be able to talk through issues of inclusion and bias, and those can be tough conversations. That’s all the more reason to train capable facilitators at every level of your company. Collaborating is never easy all the time–and it’s even harder when the issues and challenges you’re working on together create discomfort, anxiety, or fear. But those emotions aren’t going to vanish from the workplace anytime soon. So start practicing facilitation now, and you’ll future-proof your work culture for the more diverse, fast-moving world that’s heading our way.
