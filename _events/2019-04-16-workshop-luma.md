Founded in 2010, Luma Institute has created a human-centered design methods and framework to help people and organisation innovate. They studied nearly 1,000 distinct design methods and distilled the portfolio down to 36 of the most effective tools for innovation — organized in three meta-skills categories: looking, understanding, and making.

- **Looking** : methods for observing human experience by watching people and listening to them. 
- **Understanding** : methods for analysing and synthesizing information, uncovering insights, and framing problems.
- **Making** : methods for envisioning future possibilities through concept ideation, modeling, and prototyping.

This workshop covers:
- Luma System of Innovation and Problem framing — making sure our focus on the right problem to solve. 
- Putting people first — Start by identifying who all has a stake in the problem we’re trying to solve, then use ethnographic research to develop deep understanding, empathy for those individuals and gain insights into their perspective on the challenge.
- Envisioning possibilities — Focus on generating, prioritizing and sharing breakthrough ideas for solutions that make things better for our stakeholders.
- Rapid iteration — Quickly evolve the ideas we have developed by creating a prototype, whether for a product, a service or an experience, and test it with people to gain rapid feedback and insights, so we can iterate on and improve our concepts.
