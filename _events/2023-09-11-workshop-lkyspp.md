Futures Thinking enhances the capacity of policymakers to anticipate change in complex environments, surface hidden assumptions, and to uncover weaknesses and inflexibilities in their organisations. Futures Thinking plays an important role in provoking policymakers out of their comfort zones, to consider the bigger systemic context beyond their immediate domains, and to activate the imagination, at both the individual and organisational levels, so that the future is not simply a linear extrapolation of the present.

To think about the Future has never been more relevant as we seek to make sense of our place in a landscape of rapid and profound change. Given the ever-increasing disruptions that policymakers face in their various policy domains, and where complex interconnections between socio-economic, political, technological and environmental forces are poorly understood, Futures Thinking helps to sensitise organisations to fundamental surprise by rehearsing for different futures, thus deepening their agility and resilience.

In this run of Futures for Public Policy, we will deep dive into the Future of Work, where we uncover the future challenges and opportunities in the evolving landscape of work, workforce and workplace and investigate the implications on economic and social policy. By applying our Futures Thinking to the world of work, we will explore possible future scenarios facing workers, employers and society at large, and examine the impact of these global trends on Singapore and beyond.
