## ðŸ‘‰ Why Product Tonic Lab?

In nearly every career progression scenario, the ability to learn new things quickly becomes the critical differentiating skill between hitting a career ceiling versus continual career advancement especially in an industry that naturally evolves rapidly such as technology. To progress in our career, we need to develop the ability to influence, collaborate with, or manage others. This is a program that focuses on coaching/mentoring and walks with participant the journey to becoming a product leader. It is designed for senior product managers, product designers and software engineers who want to develop their leadership style, advance in their career and build more impactful products. 

This is also true in Product. The more senior your position, the less youâ€™re evaluated on what you create, and the more youâ€™re evaluated on what product everyone around you create.
