The Inquiry-Driven Leadership is an online short course from the MIT Sloan School of Management that teaches how to adopt a questioning approach to effectively identify and solve organizational problems. 

Guided by Hal Gregersen and Roger Lehman, we learn about characteristic of the 'catalytic' questions which will help foster transformative change, shift behaviors and beliefs, and generate individual and organizational value. We also explore the conditions and behavioral habits that facilitate the space for asking better questions, and develop the ability to find, frame, and solve challenges. By learning how to facilitate productive inquiry with a question-based mindset, we can uncover new insights and opportunities for innovation. 

There are 6 modules: 

MODULE 1 APPRECIATING THE POWER OF CATALYTIC QUESTIONS  
Recognize how better answers are a result of asking better questions and explore how to apply a question-based approach to challenges in personal and professional life.

MODULE 2 CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR QUESTIONS TO FLOURISH  
Learn how to create and benefit from the conditions that stimulate catalytic questions.

MODULE 3 BUILDING THE HABITS OF PRODUCTIVE INQUIRY  
Explore the habits, methods and tools that foster, promote and reinforce your questioning capacity

MODULE 4 UNDERSTANDING AND WORKING THROUGH THE BARRIERS TO INQUIRY  
Recognize structural, cognitive (i.e. keystone, shadow questions), and behavioral barriers that constraint our questioning capacity.

MODULE 5 BUILDING THE QUESTIONING CAPACITY OF A TEAM OR ORGANIZATION  
Learn how to model, enable, and motivate a question-driven approach in team or organization.

MODULE 6 CHANGING THE WORLD BY CHANGING THE QUESTIONS
Investigate and articulate questions that can meaningfully engage with a future reshaped by digital transformation
