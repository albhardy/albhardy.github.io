Presented by Tribal Worldwide and supported by DesignSingapore Council, A Beautiful Design, Asylum, BLACK, H55, Kilo, and Kinetic - This was a call to creatives in Singapore to share our experience of COVID-19 in a graphic artwork that will serve as Singapore’s collective COVID-19 memory for years to come.

Below is graphic illustration that I submitted, inspired by the many thermal measurement and imaging arrangement that residents have to face throughout pandemic period.
