### About the challenge
The Municipal Services Office (MSO) held its inaugural OneService Innovation Challenge (OSIC) to bring members of the public together to generate ideas and develop new services to improve the OneService (OS) user experience. 

The revamped OS App will allow future introduction of new modules such as involving the community in the upkeep of their neighbourhood, seeking residents’ feedback on local improvement projects, and providing neighbourhood information useful to residents. This is part of MSO’s effort to transform the OS digital products into a one-stop community platform to meet diverse municipal needs of residents. 

The three-day OSIC 2018 event, held from 31 August to 2 September 2018, serves as a launch pad for MSO to engage members of the larger community and saw 120 participants working in teams on their prototype ideas for the new OS App.
