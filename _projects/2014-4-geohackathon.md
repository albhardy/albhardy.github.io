Use geospatial technologies to address urban systems, demographic and environmental challenges. 
<!--more-->

GeoHackathon was a competition organised by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) in partnership with UP Singapore to explore new and innovative ways to use mapping and geospatial technology. About 26 teams of 140 people from diverse communities and backgrounds came together from 6 to 8 June to address problems in society highlighted in special challenges from Non-Government Organizations and Voluntary Welfare Organisations, such as Food from the Heart, who are seeking app that helps the hotline operator alert volunteers to manage their volunteers assignment based on their availability and locations.

### The Brief
Food from the Heart (FFTH) is a non-profit charity who collect unsold bread from over 100 bakeries daily and deliver it to over 150 welfare homes and 28 self-collection centres. As part of the challenge, they would like to have an application that helps their operations to deal with last-minute replacements of volunteers and enable available volunteers to pick up jobs based on their locations.

### Idea: FoodTrek
*Resource Management and Map Visualisation System.*

Our inspiration comes from understanding the need to address FFTH operational supply and demand fluctuation as well as the need to improve their operational scale and outreach. To achieve this objective, we proposed both web and mobile based application that provide operational visibility and automation for FFTH partner and beneficiary organisations as well as volunteers. 

Besides highlighting location of key resources, our geospatial visualisation is also able to estimate outer edge of all possible travel routes from a start point to a given distance or time.
