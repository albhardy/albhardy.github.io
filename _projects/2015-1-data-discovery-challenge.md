Enable smarter enterprises and improve how we live, work, learn and interact in Singapore.
<!--more-->

The Data Discovery Challenge was organised to look for innovative solutions to help open Singapore’s wealth of data and discover new insights! The Challenge sought to encourage the use of a wide range of private and public datasets to discover new value and benefits towards enabling smarter enterprises and improve how we live, work, learn and interact in Singapore.

### The Brief
Exploring and getting around is an essential part of people’s behaviour in a city. We find the nearest drive-thru to satisfy our late night craving or hop on a bus to try the dessert that has been the talk of the town. While transport maps and timetables help people work out how to get from A to B using various forms of transport, they often do not help when you are not familiar with the area or do not know yet what journey you want to make. 

This is where there is a need to analyse and understand quickly and easily places we consider– often in minutes rather than meters because we perceive ‘how long’ better than ‘how far’. An hour on the bus tells us a lot more than 47 km. This becomes even more challenging in situation where there are multiple people involved or considerations in deciding course of actions. Understanding constraints involved has a big influence on the efficiency with which they can be solved.

### Idea: Project Venn
*Intersection of space and time.*

We created *Venn* as a web-based application travel time maps also known as isochrones geographical reachability maps to solve above urban exploration and resource coordination issues.

Isochrone maps (greek: iso = equal, chronos = time) are line connecting points that have the same travel time from a specified location, i.e. which can be reached within the specified time or less. Using colours and contour lines they show constraint on how long it takes to travel between one particular place and every other place in the area using chosen mode of transport. Our interactive isochrone map visualization allows people to select areas of interest, or explore temporal mobility patterns based on modes of transport, travel time and other preferences.
