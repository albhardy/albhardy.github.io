The Data Discovery Challenge was organised by IDA to look for innovative solutions to help open Singapore’s wealth of data and discover new insights! The Challenge sought to encourage the use of a wide range of private and public datasets to discover new value and benefits towards enabling smarter enterprises and improve how we live, work, learn and interact in Singapore.

### The Brief
The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) has launched the inaugural Data Discovery Challenge, aiming to raise businesses and consumers' understanding and use of data.

Through the competition, it seeks to raise awareness on the benefits of making available private datasets, which when pooled with other datasets, is able to uncover new insights and values, bringing the data to better use and helping enterprises to create new products and services.

It is also the first challenge to utilize a federated dataset discovery mechanism (named the Federated Dataset Registry or FDSR) that seeks to provide a coherent method to dataset discovery in the private sector.

The FDSR was launched as part of the Data-as-a-Service pilot last October to support the development of a Data Marketplace where both public and private sectors data can be shared or used for commerce.

“Singapore is on its way to be the world’s first Smart Nation. We well understand the importance of finding new ways to effectively use data to deal with challenges of healthcare, transport and energy, to name just three areas,” said IDA executive deputy chairman, Steve Leonard.

Data Discovery Challenge was the first competition to utilize a federated dataset discovery mechanism i.e. Federated Dataset Registry (FDSR) that seeks to provide a coherent method to dataset discovery in the private sector. The FDSR was launched as part of the Data-as-a-Service pilot to support the development of a Data Marketplace, which is one of the preliminary ideas outlined for the Infocomm Media Masterplan. The pooling of the datasets drove innovation from data insight and created value to enable a Smart Nation for businesses and consumers.


ingapore is building the world’s first Smart Nation where data and analytics will play a critical role. To support this vision, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) today announced the start of a new Data Discovery Challenge. 

Through the Data Discovery Challenge, it seeks to raise awareness to enterprises on the benefits of making available private datasets, which when pooled with other datasets, is able to uncover new insights and values, bringing the data to better use and helping enterprises to create new products and services, enhance customer’s experience or improve their business operations in a Smart Nation. The possibilities are endless.

It is also the first challenge to utilize a federated dataset discovery mechanism (named the Federated Dataset Registry or FDSR) that seeks to provide a coherent method to dataset discovery in the private sector. The FDSR was launched as part of the Data-as-a-Service pilot in October this year to support the development of a Data Marketplace where both public and private sectors data can be shared or used for commerce. This is one of the preliminary ideas being outlined for the Infocomm Media Masterplan. Public datasets are already available through central portals such as data.gov.sg. 


If you're a data enthusiast looking to showcase your abilities – create a new service or app to help private enterprises make better business decisions, identify new business opportunities or develop new products and services – this is your challenge. Your solution could be the next Smart Nation innovation! Everyone in the business community – data scientists, analysts, enthusiasts, application developers and technology solution providers –  is invited. This is a great showcase for your work and an opportunity to make your mark and get exposure to other SMEs and MNCs that are building data-driven solutions. Tap into the "New Oil" of the 21st Century – data – and reap the rewards!  

Exploring and getting around is an essential part of people’s behaviour in a city. We find the nearest drive-thru to satisfy our late night craving or hop on a bus to try the dessert that has been the talk of the town. While transport maps and timetables help people work out how to get from A to B using various forms of transport, they often do not help when you are not familiar with the area or do not know yet what journey you want to make. 

This is where there is a need to analyse and understand quickly and easily places we consider– often in minutes rather than meters because we perceive ‘how long’ better than ‘how far’. An hour on the bus tells us a lot more than 47 km. This becomes even more challenging in situation where there are multiple people involved or considerations in deciding course of actions. Understanding constraints involved has a big influence on the efficiency with which they can be solved.

### Idea: Project Venn
*Intersection of space and time.*

We created *Venn* as a web-based application travel time maps also known as isochrones geographical reachability maps to solve above urban exploration and resource coordination issues.

Isochrone maps (greek: iso = equal, chronos = time) are line connecting points that have the same travel time from a specified location, i.e. which can be reached within the specified time or less. Using colours and contour lines they show constraint on how long it takes to travel between one particular place and every other place in the area using chosen mode of transport. Our interactive isochrone map visualization allows people to select areas of interest, or explore temporal mobility patterns based on modes of transport, travel time and other preferences.
