### Web 1.0 & Information Studies (2001 - 2006)
I graduated as [Computer Engineer](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and started my career as Web Designer at [CrimsonLogic](https://www.crimsonlogic.com/) (back when it was known as [Singapore Network Services](https://hbr.org/1992/05/singapore-invests-in-the-nation-corporation)). I was involved in in-house Corporate and Intranet portals as well as Legal, Trade and Logistic related products such as TradeNet, TradePallette, TradeXChange, EFS, Lawnet and AsianConnect. 

<!-- During that period, Macromedia Dreamweaver and ["spacer.gif"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacer_GIF) were the way we did UI design. In 2003, [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) appeared - inspiring designers to adopt cleaner HTML based on Web Standard. Combining CSS and JSP Tag Library, we developed primitive version of “Design System” to promote consistent and reusable user interfaces.  -->

Our design team built plenty animated intros and interactive demos using Macromedia Flash and ActionScript - Followed with [“Rich Internet Application”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_web_application) and [“Adobe Air”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR) concept to bring the best of desktop and web applications. I learnt architectural needs and challenges in building interactive enterprise applications when our team took ambitious undertaking to build CRM RIA for in-house call center. 

I was also involved in the [TrustSg project](https://www.imda.gov.sg/news-and-events/Media-Room/archived/ida/Media-Releases/2002/20061120095852), a nation-wide digital trust mark initiative by the National Trust Council to build confidence in e-commerce transactions using motion and dynamically generated watermark. Given close interaction with administrators and technical team, I developed curiosity in systems operations and obtained Microsoft Certification as System Administrator for Windows Server 2003.

Concurrent with growing awareness of application of design beyond aesthetic and emergence of Social Web - I took part time [postgraduate courses on Information Studies](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/graduate-programme/master-of-science-in-information-studies) to further my skills on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as well as traditional and digital information assets management. 

### Elearning and Gamification (2006 - 2008)
I joined ICUS, a bespoke provider of customized eLearning services and solutions for corporate education. There I was involved designing many interactive contents and games delivered to enhance working professionals’ learning experience in Aviation, Banking and Consulting.

I had the opportunity to learn from our instructional designers on adult learning approach with [ADDIE model](https://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/chapter/6-5-the-addie-model/) and [Bloom’s taxonomy](https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/) to bring clarity, motivation and engagement. We have strong project management and team culture which allows us to build great relationships with our customers. The company was acquired by Academee in 2007 and subsequently acquired by [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/media-center/2008/oliver-wyman-acquires-academee.html) in April 2008. 

### Web 2.0, Corporate R&D and Hackathons (2008 - 2016)
I moved to Technology Office department in ST Electronics Info-Software Systems (Now [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/)) - notably one of the major ICT players in Singapore. This is where I was exposed to the Corporate R&D role in conceptualizing and envisioning new innovations for internal and external customers. 

Some of the projects that were publicly disclosed are [iSAAC for Airport Operations](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA608625) which was showcased during Singapore Airshow 2010 and SCDF [Advanced C3 Emergency System (ACES)](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/latest-news/news-releases/news-releases-2009/fact-sheet-contract-signing-ceremony-for-scdfs-next-generation-command-and-control-system) commissioned in late Nov 2013. 

I expanded my role beyond design into project and product management with close collaboration with engineering and business teams on requirements, design, roadmap, execution, funding and KPI monitoring. During this period, User Experience design started to gain wider recognition. We started integrating complementary roles of User Centered Design with Agile development practice for innovation. At that time, such approach was quite atypical given strong project engineering culture and practices.

I was given opportunity to take additional role as CTO Secretary administering a broad variety of tasks with Senior Management across ST Electronics subsidiaries. This requires me to be adept in communication and coordination of activities to support the CTO’s agenda.

 <!-- with the local community UXSG established in 2012 and the General Assembly campus arrived in Singapore in 2015 -->


Aside from my professional work, I got to know and participated in several “community hackathons” organized by [Urban Prototyping (UP) Singapore](https://upsingapore.com/) since 2014. They are community where people from the public, private and people sectors can come together to tackle the wide variety of socio-economic and environmental challenges such as aging, health, tourism and the maritime port. 

It was roller coaster ride with plenty ups and downs from pitching and realising ideas through participation in those hackathons. found inspiration and motivation for making positive social changes by applying design thinking, prototyping, business models and value proposition design skills. The challenges and need for making social impact became key factors for making a move my next company. 

### Social Value Creation R&D (2016 - Now)
After 8 years, I decided to join [NEC Laboratories Singapore (NLS)](https://sg.nec.com/en_SG/about/about-nec-asia-pacific/nec-labs-singapore/index.html) which was established in 2013 as one of the R & D global labs of NEC Corporation. Since its founding in 1899, NEC has established a rich history of innovations from sea to outer space with missions to create social values for society and promote a more sustainable world.

I was the first NLS member with a design background. There I introduced and built User Experience Design Practice. We set up an [Advanced Center for Experimentation](https://www.nec.com/en/press/201708/global_20170803_01.html) in 2017 as a _"living lab"_ for co-creation of innovative solutions with customers and partners. 

Our mission is to apply early R&D technologies for Proof-of-Concepts and Open Innovation projects. Some of these technologies include variety of Video Analytics and Recognition (Face, Behavior, Gaze, Pose, Vehicle and more) technologies as well as Natural Language Processing and Recommendation System. I had the opportunity to work across various domains and topics such as Public Safety, Transport Mobility, Tourism, Hospitality and Healthcare. 

I’m currently leading Business Design initiatives, in-charge of new platform, products and services explorations. Through this role, I'm leveraging design know-how to expand our collaborative research activities and accelerate time-to-market.
