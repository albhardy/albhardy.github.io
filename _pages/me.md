### Web 1.0 & Information Studies (2001 - 2006)

I earned my degree in [Computer Engineer](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) and embarked on my professional journey as a Web Designer at [Singapore Network Services](https://hbr.org/1992/05/singapore-invests-in-the-nation-corporation) (Now [CrimsonLogic](https://www.crimsonlogic.com/)). In this role, I contributed to the design of Corporate Intranet and Internet products related to Legal, Trade and Logistics sectors such as TradeNet, TradePallette, TradeXChange, EFS, Lawnet, and AsianConnect.

Within our team, we created animated intros and interactive demos utilizing Macromedia Flash and ActionScript. Embracing Rich Internet Application concept, we introduced new user experience that combine responsiveness of desktop and intelligence of online web. My understanding of architectural requirements deepened when our team undertook the challenge of developing a CRM Rich Internet Application for an in-house call center, which was featured during Macromedia Product Launch in 2004.

Other technical projects that I contributed were Corporate Design System based on JSP Tag Library and TrustSg project, a nationwide digital trust mark initiative by the National Trust Council. This initiative aimed to instill confidence in e-commerce transactions through motion and dynamically generated watermarks. Through close collaboration with administrators and the technical development team, my interest in systems administration & operations grew, leading me to obtain Microsoft Certification as a System Administrator for Windows Server 2003.

Simultaneously, as the awareness of design's broader applications and the rise of the Social Web unfolded, I pursued part-time [Postgraduate on Information Studies](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/graduate-programme/master-of-science-in-information-studies). This endeavor aimed to enhance my skills in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and traditional as well as digital information asset management.

<!-- During that period, Macromedia Dreamweaver and ["spacer.gif"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacer_GIF) were the way we did UI design. In 2003, [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) appeared - inspiring designers to adopt cleaner HTML based on Web Standard. Combining CSS and JSP Tag Library, we developed primitive version of “Design System” to promote consistent and reusable user interfaces.  -->

### Elearning and Gamification (2006 - 2008)
I joined as Visual Designer of ICUS, one of leading [corporate eLearning service providers](https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/archived/ida/speeches/2001/20061218103646), to craft interactive content tailored that enrich the learning journey of Aviation, Banking, and Consulting professionals.

During my time at ICUS, I gained valuable insights from instructional designers in incorporating adult learning principles. This approach aimed to enhance clarity, motivation, and engagement in the learning materials we developed. The company's robust visual design, project management and collaborative team culture also enabled us to establish strong connections with our clients.

In 2007, ICUS was acquired by the UK-based Academee and eventually by  [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com/media-center/2008/oliver-wyman-acquires-academee.html) in April 2008, marking a significant milestone in the company's growth.

### Web 2.0, Corporate R&D and Hackathons (2008 - 2016)
I moved to the Technology Office department at ST Electronics Info-Software Systems (now [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/)), a prominent ICT player in Singapore. This marked my entry into the Corporate R&D realm as Individual Contributor in conceptualizing and envisioning innovative solutions for both internal and external clients.

Notable projects that received public attention include [iSAAC for Airport Operations](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA608625), showcased during the Singapore Airshow 2010, and the SCDF [Advanced C3 Emergency System (ACES)](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/latest-news/news-releases/news-releases-2009/fact-sheet-contract-signing-ceremony-for-scdfs-next-generation-command-and-control-system), commissioned in late November 2013.

My role evolved beyond design, encompassing project and product management. I closely collaborated with engineering and business teams, overseeing aspects such as requirements, design, roadmap planning, execution, funding, and KPI monitoring. This period witnessed the growing recognition of User Experience design, prompting the integration of User-Centered Design with Agile development practices—an unconventional approach in the context of the prevailing project engineering culture.

In addition to my primary responsibilities, I took on the role of CTO Secretary, handling diverse tasks in support of the CTO's agenda across various ST Electronics subsidiaries. This required effective communication and coordination with senior management.

Outside of my professional work, I became involved in "community hackathons" organized by [Urban Prototyping (UP) Singapore](https://upsingapore.com/) since 2014. These events provided a platform for individuals from the public, private, and people sectors to collaborate on addressing socio-economic and environmental challenges such as aging, health, tourism, and maritime port activities.

Participating in these hackathons was a roller coaster experience with numerous highs and lows—from pitching ideas to realizing them. The process fueled my inspiration and motivation to drive positive social change through the application of design thinking, prototyping, business models, and value proposition design. The desire to make a meaningful social impact became a pivotal factor in my decision to transition to my next professional endeavor.

### Social Value Creation R&D (2016 - Now)
After eight years, I transitioned to [NEC Laboratories Singapore (NLS)](https://sg.nec.com/en_SG/about/about-nec-asia-pacific/nec-labs-singapore/index.html), established in 2013 as one of the global R&D labs of NEC Corporation. With a legacy dating back to 1899, NEC has consistently pioneered innovations from the depths of the sea to the outer reaches of space, driven by a commitment to creating societal value and fostering a more sustainable world.

Being the first NLS member with a design background, I played a pivotal role in introducing and establishing the User Experience Design Practice. In 2017, we inaugurated the [Advanced Center for Experimentation](https://www.nec.com/en/press/201708/global_20170803_01.html), serving as a dynamic "living lab" for collaboratively creating innovative solutions with our customers and partners.

Our core mission is to leverage early R&D technologies for Proof-of-Concepts and Open Innovation initiatives. These technologies cover a broad spectrum of Video Analytics and Recognition AI (including Face, Behavior, Gaze, Pose, Vehicle, and more), alongside Digital Identity, Recommendation Systems and Natural Language Processing. My experience extends across various domains, including Public Safety, Transport Mobility, Tourism, Hospitality, and Healthcare.

At present, I lead Business Design initiatives, spearheading the exploration of new platforms, products, and services. In this capacity, I leverage design expertise to expand our collaborative research works and accelerate time-to-market, contributing to the advancement of our mission.
